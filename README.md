## Project Planning

I created this Kanban board and updated it as the project unfolded. I added missing cards and moved them to the right column accordingly. It was a great satisfaction to see all steps filling the "Done!" column.

These user flows were created based on the project requirements and they helped me foresee how the application implementation would go.
At the end, I made some updates to reflect the final product.
